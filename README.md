# meetup_rnn
In this rep I present a simple recurrent neural nwtwork based model to predict the next word in a sentence, basing on the knowledge of a book.

Two possible implementation are available.
The code is still raw, but in the future I will provide:
- dataset
- data preparation file
- full working train and test code

For the moment, I suggest the following readings:

- Data Preparation and LSTM model with tensorflow

- A Stack Overflow related question
